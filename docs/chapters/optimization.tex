Like a dynamic step size since we have this info?
Only when root finding.
(Use duel numbers).

Using error $l_2$ all the functions are twice differentiable so you can do the Lagrange form of the remainder thing.
Also only one root so how does that work with basins 

\[x_{n+1} = x_n - \frac{F(x_n)}{|\nabla F(x_n)|^2}\nabla F(x_n)\]
